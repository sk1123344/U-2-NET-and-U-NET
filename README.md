# U-2-NET
An implementation of U-2-NET ([U^2-Net: Going Deeper with Nested U-Structure for Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09007.pdf)) using PyTorch.

Based on the [PyTorch version](https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net) by NathanUA, PDillis, vincentzhang, and chenyangh.

## Application
This implementation is to reproduce the results of human portrait drawing. So we use [APDrawingGAN dataset](https://github.com/yiranran/APDrawingGAN) to train and test.
